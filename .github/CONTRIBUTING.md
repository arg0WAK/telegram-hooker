(The following agreement text is taken from [Sidekiq Legal](https://github.com/sidekiq/sidekiq/blob/main/.github/contributing.md) and adapted for the Telegram Hooker project).

By submitting a Pull Request, you disclaim any and all rights or claims to any changes submitted to the Telegram Hooker project and transfer the copyright to those changes to **arg0WAK**, who compiled all licence rights and is the initial compiler and distributor of the project.

If you are unable or unwilling to transfer these rights, simply create an issue instead of submitting a PR. The owner of repository will do this work.

This text is a legal way of saying ‘If you submit a PR to contribute to the repository, this code is ours’. **In 99.9% of contributing, this is already your intention; we hope this doesn't stop you from contributing.**
